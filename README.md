# The Complete Machine Learning Lifecycle with MLflow

Machine Learning (ML) development brings many new complexities beyond the traditional software development lifecycle. Unlike in traditional software development, ML developers want to try multiple algorithms, tools and parameters to get the best results, and they need to track this information to reproduce work. In addition, developers need to use many distinct systems to productionize models.

To solve these challenges, MLflow, an open source project, simplifies the entire ML lifecycle. MLflow introduces simple abstractions to package reproducible projects, track results, encapsulate models that can be used with many existing tools, and central respositry to share models, accelerating the ML lifecycle for organizations of any size.
